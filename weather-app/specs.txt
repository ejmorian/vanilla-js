//For your next project, I would suggest building a weather app. This project will allow you to practice your API fetching skills and working with asynchronous JavaScript. You can use an API like OpenWeatherMap to get weather data based on user location or input.

//Here are some features you can include in your weather app:

Get the user's location and display the current weather conditions for their location,

//Allow users to search for weather conditions in a specific location,

//Display additional weather data such as humidity, wind speed, and the chance of precipitation,

//Include a feature to toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit,

Add a feature to display the weather forecast for the next few days.
